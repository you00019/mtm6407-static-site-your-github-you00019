My strengths are Branding, Public relationships, Business Development, Social Media Management, Event Organization, and Planning. During my previous working experience, I was recognized by one of my companies as a diligent employee. I have led different teams working for the companyâ€™s strategic development in marketing. Meanwhile, during my studies at Algonquin College, I learned a variety of multimedia skills, such as Web Development, Content Management, UX/UI design, Video &amp; Photography Production, as well as Design Foundation in Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop. Learning these could help me boost more skills in the multimedia field.</h3>
